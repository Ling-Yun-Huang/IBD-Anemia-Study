# Anemia in inflammatory bowel disease course is associated with patients' worse outcome
📊 *Analyzing the impact of anemia on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient outcomes using advanced statistical methods*  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Anemia significantly affects the **quality of life and clinical outcomes** in patients with **inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**. However, there has been **limited research in Asian populations**.  

📍 **Objective:** Investigate the **prevalence, risk factors, and impact of anemia** in IBD patients in Taiwan.  
🏥 **Data Source:** 1604 IBD patients from **National Taiwan University Hospital** (2006–2018).  
📈 **Key Insight:** **Persistent anemia leads to worse outcomes, including higher hospitalization and mortality rates**.

## 🔍 Key Findings  
📢 **Anemia screening improved over time**  
✅ 62.6% of IBD patients were screened in **2006** → **77.2%** by **2017**  
✅ Mean time to anemia screening:  
   - **Crohn’s Disease (CD):** 122.4 days  
   - **Ulcerative Colitis (UC):** 216.2 days  

📢 **Persistent anemia is a major concern**  
🩸 **47.3%** of screened IBD patients had persistent anemia  

📢 **Major risk factors for persistent anemia**  
🔹 **Low BMI** (**OR = 1.96, p < 0.01**)  
🔹 **Steroid use** (**OR = 2.96, p < 0.01**)  
🔹 **Thiopurine therapy** (**OR = 2.62, p < 0.01**)  
🔹 **Colectomy** (**OR = 6.3, p < 0.01**)  
🔹 **Small bowel resection** (**OR = 3.21, p < 0.05**)  

📢 **Clinical Impact**  
⚠️ **Anemic IBD patients had significantly higher**:  
- **Hospital admission rates** (**p < 0.01**)  
- **Mortality rates** (**p < 0.01**)  

📢 **Recommendation**  
✅ **Early anemia screening & treatment** should be prioritized in IBD management
